# How to compete with space X? 

This is the final project for Coursea's IBM Data Science Certificate program. SpaceX boasts about its capacity to reduce cost due to its ability to reuse the first stage of its rocket launch.
This project use machine learning to understand whether the first stage of the rocket will launch successfully. 
- Data was collected using spaceX API and webscraping Wikipedia page.
- Data was cleaned and formatted to maintain its integrity
- Perform different analysis and run different machine learning classficiation modells to find the best model to use for prediction.
